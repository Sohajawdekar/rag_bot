### Overview of the architecture used : <br />

#### Indexingâ€‹

Load: First we need to load our data. Weâ€™ll use DocumentLoaders for this. <br />
Split: Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and wonâ€™t fit in a modelâ€™s finite context window. <br />
Store: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model. <br />

#### Retrieval and generationâ€‹

Retrieve: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a Retriever. <br />
Generate: A ChatModel / LLM produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data

# <a id="Future-Work"></a>Future Work

- Chatbot having memory buffer to improve the recommendation after every promp from the user.
  Contextualizing questions: Add a sub-chain that takes the latest user question and reformulates it in the context of the chat history.
- Using an ml-model with more number of parameters like llama-2. Fine-tuning the chatbot to maintain the original capabilities of the model while adapting it to suit more specialized use cases.
- The incorporation of the machine learning model into the user interface is slated for future implementation.
